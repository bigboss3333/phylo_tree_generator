# phylo_tree_generator
This collection is intended to provide a software solution that is easier to use yet more extensible than current state of the art.
Goals: 
* Allow for use of a number of alignment files and potentially adding an alignment generator.
* Allow more low level editing of the tree output without advanced knowledge of Biopython/matplotlib.
* Pipeline capability for building large taxa into trees that will be usful for analysis.
